Hi! Iâ€™m Robert, a Digital Marketing Manager at <a href=https://botpress.com>Botpress</a>, an artificial intelligence startup.

I hold a PhD in English from the University of Oxford, an MA from the University of Toronto, and a BA (hons.) from McGill University. In my work, I use the skills I developed throughout my academic career to translate complex engineering into thoughtful product marketing initiatives and go-to-market strategies.
